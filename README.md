# Machine-learning

This repo is specially created for all the machine learning project using Python and Tensorflow

Deep Learning Neural Network 
- Implement the deep net model and train it using stochastic gradient descent using Tensorflow and Python.  
- Create the instance of neural network and calculate the predicted output and loss. 

Poison Mushrooms Classification 
- Distinguish the safe to eat or poison mushrooms from the dataset including 3000 hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms using Python and Tensorflow. 
- Apply principal component analysis, k means clustering, logistic regression, random forest on the given dataset. 
- Plot the “receiver operating curve" to select the best machine learning model and rate their performance

Linear MRF model for Image Denoising 
- Build a structured prediction markov random field model then get unary and pairewise beliefs with highest scores using Tensorflow and Python. 
- Recover original noisy images to denoised images after applying the linear MRF model.  

Classify audio file by binary classification model 
- Distinguish letters in the ee-set (B,C,D,E,G,P,T,V,Z) from letters in the eh-set (F,L,M,N,S,X) using a logistic classifier from over 3000 audio datasets. 
- Extract features from audio waveforms of letters of the alphabet. Apply binary classification model to reach 91% accuracy rate.

K means classification
- Classify the iris.dataset by kmeans and calculate the best centroid.
